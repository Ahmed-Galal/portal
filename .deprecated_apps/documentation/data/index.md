# Chameleon Documentation

Welcome to the Chameleon cloud testbed. Our initial documentation consists of:

* A [Getting Started](getting-started) guide
* How to transition from FutureGrid to [FutureGrid@Chameleon](futuregrid)
* How to get a [Chameleon account](accounts)
* How to get a [Chameleon allocation](allocations)
* [User guides](user-guides) that describe how to use Chameleon

If you already have any questions not answered by our documentation, [login and submit a ticket](/help/) or
[submit a ticket as a guest](/help/ticket/new/guest). We'll get back to you as soon as we can.
