# Activating a FutureGrid Allocation

All FutureGrid allocations have been entered into Chameleon, but they must be activated before they can be
used. Only the PI of the FutureGrid allocation can claim it in Chameleon.

The PI must first [activate their Chameleon account](../accounts). The PI can then log in to the Chameleon
portal and go to their [allocation](/user/projects/) page. This page lists the Chameleon allocation requests
(former FutureGrid projects) as 'Incomplete'. The PI simply needs to 'Edit' the allocation request, fill in
any missing information, and submit the request. The allocation request will be approved quickly.

If you are not the PI of the FutureGrid project you wish to activate in Chameleon, your
[allocation](/user/projects/futuregrid/) page includes a list of Chameleon allocation requests (former FutureGrid projects)
that list you as a user. Contact the 'Requester' of the allocation and ask them to activate it.
