# Activating a FutureGrid Allocation

All FutureGrid allocations have been entered into Chameleon, but they must be
activated before they can be used. Only the Project Manager or Lead of the
FutureGrid allocation can claim it in Chameleon. If you are a member of a
project you will be able to view the project information and we will provide you
links to contact the Manager/Lead if you would like to see the project migrated.

After [activating your Chameleon account](../accounts), visit the
[FutureGrid@Chameleon](/user/projects/futuregrid) page to view the FutureGrid
projects that are available for migration. Migrated projects are queued for
fast-track approval so that users can continue working on Chameleon.

After migrating a project, you will be provided with a list of the former
members of the project on FutureGrid. If these users have an account on
Chameleon it is a one-click process to add them back to the project on
Chameleon. For users that don't already have a Chameleon account, you can easily
invite those users to create an account on Chameleon.
