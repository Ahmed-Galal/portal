# Activating a FutureGrid Account

If you were a FutureGrid user, we have a very simple process for you to activate
your Chameleon account.

[Create a new Chameleon Account](/user/register/) using the same email address
as you used for you FutureGrid Account. You will receive an email confirmation
to verify your account. Once you log in, you can
[review your FutureGrid projects](/user/projects/futuregrid) and proceed from
there to [activate your FutureGrid project on Chameleon](../allocations).
