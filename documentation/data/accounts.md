# Chameleon User Accounts

Faculty, staff, and students at educational institutions, government laboratories, and companies in the United
States and in many countries around the world are eligible for Chameleon accounts.

To get started using Chameleon, [Request an account](/user/register/). If you wish to be able to request
Chameleon allocations, select "Request PI" on that form. The guidelines for who we will approve as PI status
is described on our [allocation](../allocations) page.

## Claiming a FutureGrid Account

If you were a FutureGrid user, you already have an account on Chameleon, you just need to activate it. See our
[FutureGrid account documentation](../futuregrid/accounts) for more information.
