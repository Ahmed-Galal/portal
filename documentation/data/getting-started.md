# Getting Started

To get started using Chameleon you will need an account and an allocation. We
are currently supporting FutureGrid@Chameleon to allow FutureGrid users to
continue their work during the initial transitional phase of the project. We are
also accepting new allocation requests.

Once you have an account and an allocation, [read the user guides](/docs/user-guides) and then
[go to the Alamo OpenStack web interface](https://horizon.chameleon.tacc.utexas.edu) to get started.

## FutureGrid Users

**Were you a FutureGrid user?** We invite you to continue the work you
were doing on FutureGrid on Chameleon during this initial transitional phase
of the project.

[Follow these instructions](/docs/futuregrid/accounts) to activate your
Chameleon account. Then you will be able to
[request to have your FutureGrid project migrated](/docs/futuregrid/allocations)
to Chameleon.

## New Chameleon Users

**Are you a new user?** [Request an account](/register) and then
[request an allocation](/user/projects). You can also ask
the PI of an existing project to add you to their project.
