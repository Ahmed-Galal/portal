# Getting Started

Chameleon provides a large-scale testbed to support research, development, and education related to cloud
computing. During our initial FutureGrid@Chameleon phase, we are supporting former FutureGrid users and new
users on two clusters (Alamo and Hotel) that were previously part of FutureGrid.

We will be building our Chameleon software environment using these two systems and our new large-scale
hardware will arrive in 2015. See our [project
schedule](/news/2014/07/23/chameleon-cloud-will-be-launching-soon/) for more information.

## Accounts

To get started using Chameleon you will need a user account.  Faculty, staff, and students at educational
institutions, government laboratories, and companies in the United States and in many countries around the
world are eligible for Chameleon accounts. You will need to agree to the [Chameleon terms and
conditions](/terms/) as part of the process of creating an account.

**Were you a FutureGrid user?** [Follow these instructions](/docs/futuregrid/accounts) to activate your
Chameleon account.

**Are you a new user?** [Request an account](/register)

## Allocations

To use Chameleon, you will also need to be associated with a valid allocation (also known as a
project). Chameleon accounts for all resource use against allocations so that we know how much each of our
projects uses Chameleon and so that we can ensure that the projects are getting a fair share of our
resources.

A group of users (led by a Principle Investigator) request an allocation so that they can use Chameleon for a
focused project. Granted allocations are typically valid for one year.

To be a Chameleon PI and request allocations, you must be faculty or research staff at a U.S. educational
institution (this is often referred to as “PI status” by your organization). We do provide case-by-case
exceptions to this guideline.

Chameleon reviews allocation requests to ensure that we provide the most benefit possible to our targeted user
communities.  Small startup allocation requests are reviewed by Chameleon staff. Larger allocation requests
will be reviewed by an allocation committee consisting of unbiased experts that are not part of the Chameleon
project.  Review criteria include:

1. Valid objectives: That the work fits within the Chameleon mission of supporting research, development, and
education in cloud computing.

2. Appropriate methodology: That the project describes the techniques that they will use to meet their
objectives in sufficient detail and that this methodology is appropriate to reach their objectives on
Chameleon.

3. Appropriate resource use: That Chameleon is the most appropriate resource for the proposed work, that a
sufficient amount of resources is requested to complete the work, and that the project will use the resources
efficiently.

4. Prevous usage: That the project team made effective use of any previous Chameleon allocations and abided by
our terms and conditions.

In addition, during the FutureGrid@Chameleon transition phase, Chameleon welcomes FutureGrid projects without
review. These projects will be able to use Chameleon until approximately April 1, 2015. After this time, the
PIs of these projects will need to submit new Chameleon allocation requests to use the new Chameleon hardware.

**Were you a FutureGrid user?** [Request to have your FutureGrid project
migrated](/docs/futuregrid/allocations) to Chameleon.

**Are you a new user?** [request an allocation](/user/projects) or ask the PI of an existing Chameleon project
to add you to their project.

## Using Chameleon

We are currently providing virtual machines to users via OpenStack. You can learn about how to use OpenStack
in our [user guides](/docs/user-guides) and access OpenStack using
[the Alamo OpenStack web interface](https://horizon.chameleon.tacc.utexas.edu).

If you already have a Chameleon account and have any questions or encounter any problems, [submit a
ticket](/help/) and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. If you don't have a Chameleon account yet, you
can still [submit a ticket](/help/ticket/new/guest) and you'll receive an email response.
