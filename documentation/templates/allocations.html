# Chameleon Allocations

All usage of Chameleon is charged to allocations. You must therefore either be authorized to charge to one
or more allocations, or you can apply for your own allocation.

To be eligible to request an allocation on Chameleon, you must be faculty or research staff at a
U.S. educational institution (this is often referred to as "PI status" by your organization). We do provide
case-by-case exceptions to this guideline.

If you have a [Chameleon user account](accounts.html) with PI status, you can [request an
allocation](/allocation/request/).

## Activating a FutureGrid Allocation

If you were the PI of a FutureGrid project, you already have an allocation on Chameleon, you just
need to activate it. See our [FutureGrid allocation documentation](futuregrid/allocations.html) for more
information.
