# Chameleon User Accounts

Faculty, staff, and students at educational institutions, government laboratories, and companies in the United
States and in many countries around the world are eligible for Chameleon accounts.

To be eligible to request [allocations](allocations.html) on Chameleon, you must be faculty or research staff
at a U.S. educational institution (This is often referred to as "PI status" by your organization). We do provide
case-by-case exceptions to this guideline.

To get started using Chameleon, [Request an account](/user/request/).

## Claiming a FutureGrid Account

If you were a FutureGrid user, you already have an account on Chameleon, you just need to activate it. See our
[FutureGrid account documentation](futuregrid/accounts.html) for more information.
