## Activating a FutureGrid Account

If you were a FutureGrid user, we have a very simple process for you to activate your Chameleon account.

Simply enter the user name or email address you used with FutureGrid into our email-based [password
recovery](/user/password_reset/recover) process. You will receive an email with a link where you can set a
password for Chameleon.
